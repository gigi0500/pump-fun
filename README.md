   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory and configure the following:

   ```makefile
     MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
     NODE_ENV=development
   ```

5. **Start the Database**  
   Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
